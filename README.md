# Noni Full Stack Developer Coding Challenge

## Objective

To create a note taking app using Laravel and VueJS.

## Insructions

You are going to use a pre-configured dockerized application to create a simple CRUD application. Laravel is used on the back-end Vuejs is used on the front end as a SPA.

_Note: There is already JWT authentication implemented for the app._

**TODO:** The application should allow you to create, edit, and delete delete notes. Notes will be save to the database. Notes will have a title, content, and created_at displayed on the front end.

1.  Save the created notes in the database
2.  Create the necessary table with Laravel migrations
3.  Related any created notes to the authenticated user that created it
4.  Created all require restful routes to achieve the CRUD functionality
5.  Created required Front End components to access the API you created
6.  Authenticated user needs to be able to view all notes, create new notes, edit existing notes, and delete notes.

Include front-end and bak-end validation. Additional marks will be given for UX/design.
Feel free to use your creativity and design skills to make the existing site design your own.

## Setup

The project comes with a dockerized development environment and should include everything you need to get working right away.

This setup requires that you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system.

**Docker installation instructions here:**
[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Copy Laravel environment file**
(While in project root)

```
cp .env.example .env
```

**Copy Laradock environment files**

```
cd laradock

cp env-example .env
```

**Run docker containers**

```
docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin redis workspace
```

**Enter workspace container**

```
docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash
```

**Install dependencies and build existing database**

```
composer install
npm install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

**Build app**

```
npm run watch
```

The application should now be available at http://localhost
