## Setup

The project comes with a dockerized development environment and should include everything you need to get working right away.

This setup requires that you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system.

**Docker installation instructions here:**
[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Copy Laravel environment file**
(While in project root)

```
cp .env.example .env
```

**Copy Laradock environment files**

```
cd laradock

cp env-example .env
```

**Run docker containers**

```
docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin redis workspace
```

**Enter workspace container**

```
docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash
```

**Install dependencies and build existing database**

```
rm -rf vendor
rm -rf composer.lock
composer install
composer require jslmariano/notelist
composer dump-autoload
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jslmariano\Notelist\Providers\NotesServiceProvider"
npm install --no-bin-links
npm install cross-env --no-bin-links
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

**Build app**

```
npm run watch
```

**Refresh jslmariano/notelist package (IF THERE) after code modifications**

```
rm -rf vendor/jslmariano
composer update jslmariano/notelist
rm -rf resources/js/pages/notes
rm -rf resources/js/store/modules/notes.js
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jslmariano\Notelist\Providers\NotesServiceProvider"

# IF modified a page vue file
npm run watch
```

**Testing the custom package**

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit vendor/jslmariano/notelist/tests/
```


The application should now be available at http://localhost
